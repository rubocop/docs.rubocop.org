= docs.rubocop.org

This repository contains RuboCop's documentation site. It's home to both
the documentation of RuboCop itself, plus that of its core extensions (the ones
maintained by RuboCop's Core Team).

The site is generated from the AsciiDoc files in the
link:https://github.com/rubocop-hq/rubocop/tree/master/docs[docs] folder of
RuboCop's GitHub repo (and the core RuboCop extensions like `rubocop-rspec`) and
is published to https://docs.rubocop.org.  link:https://antora.org[Antora] is
used to convert the manual into HTML.  The filesystem layout is described
https://docs.antora.org/antora/2.3/standard-directories/[here].

You can find a list of all the documentation modules that are weaved together in the
final site in `antora-playbook.yml`.

To make changes to the manual you simply have to change the files under `docs` in the relevant
repository.
The docs will be regenerated manually periodically.

== Installing Antora

Installing the Antora is super simple:

[source]
----
$ npm i -g @antora/cli@3.0.1 @antora/site-generator@3.0.1
----

Check out https://docs.antora.org/antora/3.0/install/install-antora/[the detailed installation instructions]
if you run into any problems.

== Building the Site

You can build the documentation locally from this repo.

[source]
----
$ cd docs.rubocop.org
$ antora --fetch antora-playbook.yml
----

TIP: You can preview your changes by opening `docs/index.html` in your favorite browser.

Afterwards you can publish your changes like this:

[source]
----
$ git add docs
$ git commit -m 'Update site docs'
$ git push
----

You can also use the `deploy` script to publish changes in a single step:

[source]
----
$ ./deploy
----

It basically does `antora --fetch` and `git push`.

NOTE: You'll need commit access to the repository for this to work.

If you want to make changes to the manual's page structure you'll have to edit
link:https://github.com/rubocop-hq/rubocop/blob/master/doc/modules/ROOT/nav.adoc[nav.adoc].

== Updating the Playbook

When cutting new releases you'll have to updated `antora-playbook.yml` to mention
their relevant tags from which the documentation needs to be build. Here's how this
looks for one of the projects:

[source]
----
- url: https://github.com/rubocop-hq/rubocop-performance.git
  branches: master
  tags: ['v1.7.1', 'v1.8.1']
  start_path: docs
----

TIP: You need to add one such block for each new RuboCop module you're adding to the docs site.

After releases of the main RuboCop gem you also need to update the default landing
version (it should always be the latest version).

== Troubleshooting

The most common mistake that people make is to forget to update the version of an Antora docs module
after cutting a release. This will result in an error saying you've got the same version in two branches (e.g. `master`
and `v1.0`). Fixing this is pretty simple - just update the version to `master` in `antora.yml`.
